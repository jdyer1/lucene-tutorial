= Lucene Queries

Once we have loaded the indexed fields, we can search our corpus.  Here is a basic demonstration of some of the most-useful 
Lucene query types.  The unit test below shows how each can be used to find documents.

When selecting a query it is important to think about how the data was indexed.  If the data is indexed as a "string" or "keyword" field, then 
queries that match one terms will be most appropriate.  If the data is indexed as "text" the data was split into multiple terms (often split on whitespace), and 
quweries that match multiple terms can be used.  

Numeric fields like IntPoint each have producer methods that let you find numeric data in different ways. "#newExactQuery()" and "#newRangeQuery()" 
produce a query instance that does exactly what the name would suggest.  "#newSetQuery" finds documents matching any of the numbers you specify.
