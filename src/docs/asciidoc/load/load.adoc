= Load

With the document expressed as a List of Lucene Fields, we merely need to pass the individual documents to the Lucene Index writer and issue "commit" afterwards.  
Our document loader wraps the IndexWriter in a Java collector.  This collector counts the number of successful document adds.  
Should there be any failures, the first failure is saved to memory and both the document and the exception thrown can be retrieved.
